# 🔍 CRITICAL DEBUG - EDIT MODE FILES NOT LOADING

## 🐛 THE PROBLEM

**From your console logs:**
```
📝 Building MultiFileUploadWidget:
   - _filesPreviews count: 0  ❌ NO FILES!
```

**Missing logs (should appear but DON'T):**
```
📋 LOADING EXISTING REQUISITION DATA FOR EDIT MODE  ← MISSING!
🔍 Loading requisition for edit: 152  ← MISSING!
📡 Fetching requisition data from API  ← MISSING!
```

**This means:** The requisition data is NOT being loaded from the server OR `widget.requisition` is NULL!

---

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED

I added comprehensive logging to `main.dart` in the `_loadRequisitionForEdit` function to track EXACTLY what's happening.

**New logs will show:**
```
================================================================================
🔍 _loadRequisitionForEdit CALLED
================================================================================
🎯 Requisition ID to load: 152
📡 Fetching requisition data from API
📄 FILE-RELATED FIELDS:
   - jobDocuments array: X items
   📎 Files in jobDocuments:
      1. filename.pdf
```

## 🧪 TEST AGAIN - COMPLETE RELOAD

**CRITICAL:** You must do a COMPLETE page reload to see the new logs!

### Step 1: Clear Everything
1. **Close the browser tab** completely
2. **Open new browser tab**
3. **Open Console** (F12 → Console tab)
4. **Clear console** (click 🚫 icon)

### Step 2: Navigate Fresh
1. **Type in address bar:** `http://127.0.0.1:5173/reqfrom/152`
2. **Press Enter**
3. **WAIT** for page to fully load (5-10 seconds)

### Step 3: Check Console Immediately
**Look for these logs as page loads:**

```
================================================================================
🔍 _loadRequisitionForEdit CALLED
================================================================================
🎯 Requisition ID to load: 152
🔍 Loading requisition for edit: 152
🛠️ Initializing provider...
✅ Provider initialized
📡 Fetching requisition data from API: /api/v1/requisition/152/
```

### Step 4: Copy ALL Console Logs
**Copy EVERYTHING from the console** from the moment you load the page.

## ❓ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### ✅ OUTCOME A: Function is Called

      - jobDocuments array: 1 items
      📎 Files:

**Then later:**
